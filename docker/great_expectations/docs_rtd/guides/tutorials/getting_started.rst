Getting started with Great Expectations -- v2 (Batch Kwargs) API
#############################################

Welcome to Great Expectations! This tutorial will help you set up your first local deployment of Great Expectations that contains a small Expectation Suite to validate some sample data. We'll also introduce important concepts, with links to detailed material you can dig into later.

.. warning::

   The steps described in this tutorial assume you are installing Great Expectations version 0.13.8 or above and intend
   to use the v2 (Batch Kwargs) API. To understand the differences between the v2 and v3 APIs, read this
   :ref:`article <v3_vs_v2_api_v2>`.

   For a tutorial for older versions of Great Expectations, please see older
   versions of this documentation.

The tutorial will walk you through the following steps:

#. First, we will introduce you to the data and help you initialize a **Data Context**.
#. Then you will learn how to configure a **Datasource** to connect to your data.
#. You will then create your first **Expectation Suite** using the built-in **automated profiler**.
#. We'll also give you a tour of **Data Docs** to view your validation results.
#. We will show you how to use this Expectation Suite to **validate** a new batch of data.
#. Finally, in the optional section, you will learn how to **customize** your deployment.
