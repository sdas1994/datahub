How to Create Parameterized Expectations - Super Fast
_____________________________________________________

This guide will walk you through the process of creating Parameterized Expectations - very quickly. This method is only available using the new Modular Expectations API in 0.13.

.. admonition:: Prerequisites: This how-to guide assumes you have already:

  - :ref:`Set up a working deployment of Great Expectations <tutorials__getting_started>`

A Parameterized Expectation is a great new capability unlocked by new Modular Expectations. Now that Expectations are structured in class form,
it is easier than every before to inherit fromthese classes and build similar Expectations that are adapted to your own needs.

Steps
-----
1. Select an Expectation to inherit from
########################################

  For the purpose of this exercise, we will implement the new Expectation "expect_column_mean_to_be_positive" - a realistic Expectation of the data that
  can easily inherit from ``expect_column_mean_to_be_between``.

2. Select default values for your class
###########################################################

As can be seen in the implementation below, we have chosen to keep our default minimum value at 0, given that we are validating that all our values are positive. Setting the upper bound to ``None`` means that no upper bound will be checked -- effectively setting the threshold at âˆž and allowing any positive value.

Notice that we do not need to set ``default_kwarg_values`` for all kwargs: it is sufficient to set them only for ones for which we would like to set a default value. To keep our implementation simple, we do not override the ``metric_dependencies`` or ``success_keys``.

.. code-block:: python

   class ExpectColumnMeanToBePositive(ExpectColumnMeanToBeBetween):
      default_kwarg_values = {
          "min_value": 0,
          "strict_min": True,
      }

Additional Notes
----------------

#. We could also explicitly override our parent methods to modify the behavior of our new Expectation, for example by updating the configuration validation to *require* the values we set as defaults not be altered.

.. code-block:: python

    def validate_configuration(self, configuration: Optional[ExpectationConfiguration]):
        super().validate_configuration(configuration)
        assert "min_value" not in configuration.kwargs, "min_value cannot be altered"
        assert "max_value" not in configuration.kwargs, "max_value cannot be altered"
        assert "strict_min" not in configuration.kwargs, "strict_min cannot be altered"
        assert "strict_max" not in configuration.kwargs, "strict_max cannot be altered"
