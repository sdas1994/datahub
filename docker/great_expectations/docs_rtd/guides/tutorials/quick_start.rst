To unlock more of the power of Great Expectations, you'll also need to configure a Data Context. From the root of the directory where you want to deploy Great Expectations:

.. code-block:: bash

    great_expectations init

The CLI will guide you through all the steps to set up a basic deployment of Great Expectations.

After that, if you want to understand what just happened while running ``init``, check out :ref:`tutorials__getting_started`.
